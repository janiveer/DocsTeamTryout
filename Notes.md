Assuming SDK and JSON do not need spelling out in full.

The contribution notes do not make it clear whether list items that are _not_ full sentences should end in a full stop. I have added a full stop because I think it's neater.

I prefer that when a full sentence appears in parentheses, it should be have its own full stop and capital letter and be separate from the previous sentence. (I think it's easier to read.)

There should obviously be some punctuation at the end of a sentence before an image. Should it be a full stop or a colon? At the moment, where there is any punctuation at all, roughly half the images in the document have colons and half have full stops. I have changed all colons to full stops, so that if future authors move or delete an image, they won't have to remember to change the colon.

Every numbered step in a procedure should contain exactly one "do" (imperative verb).

Don't muddle up sequential (numbered) steps and alternative steps.

Using CBQ > Using Browser and Command Line Tools because this section is not just about CBQ. (Also I presume CBQ should be written in lower case, even in titles.)

Assuming "click on" not just "click".

Not sure what the rule would be for quoting gui labels in all upper case. It looks odd in the documentation. For now, I've written in in title case, which reads more easily.

Does your documentation build tool turn straight quotes into curly quotes automatically? What are the rules for writing curly quotes or apostrophes in running text? I've left them as straight for the moment.
